# Passkit Sample Client

An example client to fetch, show and add a Pass to Apple Wallet.
This experiment is based on a webserver project not yet available that generates Passes following a model.
Therefore it may **NOT** work.

This application asks for an URL to be inserted a pass type to be selected from a *UIPickerView*.
